# python-grammar
This project was made by my teammate BISWAJIT BAL and ME-DEVANSH VERMA
Made a small python syntax checking code for using plytool in python language. We used the concept of parsing and lexing.
We defined multiple tokens and grammar for each one of the syntax and executed the codes. 
We also combined all the codes in a single file.
